      <p> <b>Uzi<sup>*</sup> (Yury) Dvorkin</b> (he/him/his) is an Associate Professor at the <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/">Department of Civil and Systems Engineering</a> and at the <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/">Department of Electrical Computer Engineering</a> at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), where he is also part of JHU's <a href="https://energyinstitute.jhu.edu/">Ralph O'Connor Sustainable Energy Institute</a>. Dvorkin is the US Director of the NSF Global Climate Center on <a href="https://energyinstitute.jhu.edu/epics/">Electric Power Innovation for a Carbon-free Society</a> (EPICS). Before joining JHU, Dvorkin was an Associate and Assistant Professor, as well as a Goddard Junior Faculty Fellow, at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New York University's (NYU) Tandon School of Engineering with an affiliated appointment at NYU’s Center for Urban Science and Progress. Before joining NYU, he was a Ph.D. student (class of 2016) at the University of Washington, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://people.ece.uw.edu/kirschen/index.html">Daniel S. Kirschen</a>, and a graduate student researcher (2014) at the <a href="https://cnls.lanl.gov/External/">Center for Nonlinear Studies</a>, Los Alamos National Laboratory.  </p>
      <p> For his dissertation work, entitled “Operations and Planning in Sustainable Power Systems“, Dvorkin was awarded the inaugural <b>2016 Scientific Achievement Award</b> by Clean Energy Institute (University of Washington). Dvorkin received an <b>2019 NSF CAREER Award</b> to investigate small-scale electricity trading, <b>Goddard Junior Faculty Fellowship</b> (2019), <b>Discovery award</b> (2023), <b>Outstanding Associate Editor Award</b> at the IEEE Transactions on Energy Markets, Power and Regulation (2024), and <b>Provost’s Fellowship for Public Engagement</b> (2025). Dvorkin holds the <b>Best Paper Award (IEEE PES GM in 2014)</b> and <b>IEEE PES Prize Paper Award (IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 2023)</b>. Also, Dvorkin is a dedicated reviewer, who was awarded several <b>Best Reviewer Awards</b> from IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018), IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy (2014, 2015, 2016), and IEEE Transactions on Smart Grids (2016), and he serves as an <b>Associate Editor</b> of the IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid (since 2019) and IEEE Transactions on Energy Markets, Policy and Regulation (since 2022). </p>
		  <p> Dvorkin's research focuses on developing modeling and algorithmic solutions to assist society in accommodating emerging smart grid technologies (e.g., intermittent generation, demand response, storage, smart appliances, cyber infrastructure) using multi-disciplinary methods in engineering, operations research, economics, and policy analysis. His research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, US Department of Energy, US Department of Transportation, Advanced Research Projects-Energy, Energy Innovation, Electric Power Research Institute, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. </p>
